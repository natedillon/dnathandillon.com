notes:
  - Exact release date unknown. March 22, 2008 is the oldest snapshot from the Wayback Machine. Last backup made that might be close to the final version is from September 11, 2006, but the design is different than the way it ended up. E-mail on August 28 was still talking about pre-launch feedback, and an e-mail on September 18 indicated the URL was live.
  - Exact start date unknown. The Project folder is labeled November, 2005. The site map file date is November 14, 2005.
