notes:
  - An e-mail was sent out on August 12, 2010 saying that the new site was released.
  - Exact start date unknown. The project folder is labeled as August 2010, but some files within the folder have April and July modfied dates. Most of the design looks to have been done January-March, with somewhat final images created for a meeting on April 8. Somewhat similar designs were started July 17, 2009, and there are even some less similar designs that were started September 26, 2007.
  - I think the new site launch was the time (or close to it) that we switched domains from humec.k-state.edu to he.k-state.edu.
