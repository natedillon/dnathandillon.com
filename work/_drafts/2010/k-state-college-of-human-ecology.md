notes:
  - Exact release date unknown. A backup of the new site CSS files was made on August 10, 2010, and a WordPress export was made on June 17. The June 21, 2010 snapshot from the Wayback Machine is the old version of the site, and the August 20 snapshot is the new version.
  - Exact start date unknown. The project folder is labeled as August 2010, but some files within the folder have April and July modfied dates. Most of the design looks to have been done January-March, with somewhat final images created for a meeting on April 8. Somewhat similar designs were started July 17, 2009, and there are even some less similar designs that were started September 26, 2007.
  - I think the new site launch was the time (or close to it) that we switched domains from humec.k-state.edu to he.k-state.edu.
