My name is Nate Dillon, and I am a front-end web developer living in Manhattan, Kansas. I love building responsive, progressively enhanced websites using standards compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, watching [movies](http://letterboxd.com/natedillon/ "Nate Dillonâ€™s Letterboxd Profile") or [hockey](http://penguins.nhl.com/ "Pittsburgh Penguins"), or planning my next Disney vacation.
