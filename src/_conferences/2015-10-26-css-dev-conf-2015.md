  - title: 'Cracking the SVG Code'
    speaker:
      - name: Brenda Storer
        title: 'Designer & Front End Developer, thoughtbot'
    description: 'SVGs: their code looks kind of familiar, but have you ever tried to edit the code and end up breaking the whole darn thing?
      I have been digging into the nitty gritty of SVG code, and it’s helped me optimize my own SVGs and get started more quickly with libraries that work with SVGs like d3 and snap.svg.
      Here are a few topics I’ll cover in this session:
      Understand the mystery of the “viewBox”, the SVG coordinate system and viewport, even what all those numbers and punctuation within a “path” actually mean.
      How much of all that stuff that Sketch, Illustrator, and Inkscape exports out is actually needed, and what does it do? (“xlmns”, “enable-background”, etc.)
      What are the CSS properties that I can use to style SVGs, and when, how, and why?
      How can I use this information to animate SVGs?'

  - title: 'Smoothly Migrating to Flexbox'
    speaker:
      - name: Charlie Park
        title:
    description: 'Over the last year, we’ve taken a mammoth frontend codebase and revamped it, making it load more rapidly and reliably. I’d love to share how we used flexbox to help our designers, engineers, and users all have a better experience.
      Some considerations that we’ll look at:
      What browsers does (y)our site need to support?
      Are (y)our responsive views worked out? Or is this transition a part of that process?
      What are the things flexbox allows us to do that we had a hard time with before?
      When is flexbox NOT the right choice? (So important!)
      What alternatives do we have to flexbox that actually work on legacy browsers?
      Why “support the current browser version and two versions back” is actually fairly poor for determining your minimum-browser-required floor.
      How to progressively roll out your new design to various cohorts, so you can easily rollback if disaster strikes.'

    speaker:
      - name: Marcelo Somers
        title: 'Slalom Consulting'
    description: 'In “Fight the Zombie Pattern Library”, we’ll look at the repeatable processes that Slalom Consulting in Dallas, TX is using to “build a tiny Bootstrap” for every client and keep developers using them every day – processes you can take back and implement tomorrow.
      In this session, we will cover:
      A scalable process for your designers and developers to maintain a living style guide
      How to generate the information you need for a pattern library, especially if being handed designs to work with
      Usability tips to keep your library easily consumable by developers
      How to add a pattern library in an existing project
      Tools to rapidly spin up libraries if you’re in a consulting/agency environment'

  - title: 'Container-based RWD with Element Queries'
    speaker:
      - name: Philip Zastrow
        title: 'Developer, Sparkbox'
    description: 'The media query is a wonderful, powerful tool that allow us to make transformable websites for devices all shapes and sizes. Sometimes though, a more granular level of control is needed to make the content fit its context.
      We’ll dive into element queries and see what happens when we bring responsive principles to the components of a page.
      Overview of what are Element Queries
      How Element Queries are used
      The current state of Element Queries
      Ways to use Element Queries now'
