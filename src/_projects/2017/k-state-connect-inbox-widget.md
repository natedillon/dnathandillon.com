  - Started design work on March 28, 2017; last design file was made April 17, 2017
  - The “K-State Email” widget was re-named to “Inbox”
  - The Decisions service was added to the widget for the Division of Financial Services; client contacts were Bryan Kraus and Rob McGaughey
  - While Bootstrap was still in use in Connect itself, it was not used for the widget code
