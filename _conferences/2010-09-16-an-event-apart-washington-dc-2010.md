sessions:
  - title: 'Web 2.1: The Medium Comes of Age'
    speaker:
      - name: Jeffrey Zeldman
        title: Author, Designing With Web Standards, 3rd Ed.
    description: 'Webkit-powered smartphones like iPhone and Droid have come along at precisely the moment when HTML5, CSS3, and web fonts are ready for action; when standards-based web development is no longer relegated to the fringe; and when web designers, no longer content to merely decorate screens, are crafting provocative, multi-platform experiences powered by research, strategy, and years of social media know-how. Zeldman kicks off AEA by studying the thinking and inventions that led to the web, and showing why we stand at the dawn of a newer, more mature, more ubiquitous web, powered by standards.'
  - title: 'Object Oriented CSS'
    speaker:
      - name: Nicole Sullivan
        title: Co-author, Even Faster Websites
    description: 'How do you scale CSS for millions of visitors or thousands of pages? What happens to the size of your CSS file as more pages and modules are added? The answer, for most sites, is that it grows out of control and becomes an unmaintainable tangle of spaghetti code. Object Oriented CSS allows you to write fast, maintainable, standards-based front-end code. It adds much needed predictability to CSS so that even beginners can create beautiful websites. OOCSS is not a framework or a tool (though in this session Nicole will demo both); it is a better, saner way to write and maintain style sheets.'
  - title: 'The CSS3 Experience'
    speaker:
      - name: Dan Cederholm
        title: Author, Bulletproof Web Design and Handcrafted CSS
    description: 'In a fast-paced hour of design ideas and techniques, learn how advanced CSS and CSS3 can add richness to your site’s experience layer, and discover the role CSS3 can play in enhancing interactivity.'

    description: 'Designing for multichannel content delivery (mobile, anyone?) means an entirely new set of considerations and challenges for web professionals everywhere. Unfortunately for content creators, it’s nearly impossible to predict whether their writing will maintain impact and readability across each and every platform. But forget about the medium for a minute; it’s the message that matters most. We’ll learn how to identify your key business messages, how they inform your content strategy, and how they impact multi-channel content development and design.'

  - title: 'Everything Old Is New Again'
    speaker:
      - name: Eric Meyer
        title: Author, CSS: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Ed.
    description: 'Faux columns. Sliding doors. Image replacement. We rely on these techniques on a near-daily basis, but how will they be affected by the expanding vocabulary of CSS3? Will they be reworked, slimmed down, or abandoned altogether? An Event Apart cofounder and CSS mastermind Eric Meyer pulls some old standbys out of the toolbox and applies the capabilites of CSS3 to see how they can be made leaner, meaner, and more powerful.'
  - title: 'Paranormal Interactivity'
    speaker:
      - name: Jeremy Keith
        title: Author, DOM Scripting
    description: 'Interaction is the secret sauce of the web. Understanding interaction is key to understanding the web as its own medium—it’s not print, it’s not television, and it’s certainly not the desktop. Find out how to wield HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft experiences that are native to the web.'

    speaker:
      - name: Aarron Walter
        title: Author, Building Findable Websites
    description: 'Humans, though cute and cuddly, are not without their flaws, which makes it a challenge to design for them. By understanding how the wet, mushy processor works in these hairy little devils, you can design interfaces and web experiences that will have them hopelessly devoted to your brand.	Aarron will introduce you to the emotional usability principle—a design axiom that identifies a strong connection between human emotion and perceived usability. Through real-world examples, you’ll learn practical interface design techniques that will make your sites and applications more engaging to the humans they serve.'

In this practical, design-focused talk, Andy will discuss the “how” as well as the “why,” and challenge your preconceptions to help you make better work for the web. Learn the most modern, forward-moving, and sometimes experimental CSS techniques, and why a forward looking approach to CSS will pay real dividends.'
