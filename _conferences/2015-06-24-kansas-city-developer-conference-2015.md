    speaker:
      - name: Dustin Hudson
        title:
    description: '...if you have to explain it, it’s not very good. User experience is the heart and soul of every application from the user’s point of view, but it’s also one of the first things to be dismissed when it’s time to plan development tasks. This session takes a look at the impacts of good vs. bad UX design in real-world settings - how does the user see the application differently from the developer and how can we narrow that gap?'

  - title: '“Post” is the New “Pre”: Using Postprocessors to Revolutionize Your Workflow'
    speaker:
      - name: Aaron Ladage
        title:
    description: 'For years, front-end developers have turned to preprocessors like SASS and CoffeeScript to fill in the gaps in native languages like CSS and JavaScript. Although these tools have transformed and enhanced the way we write code, they’ve also forced us to work in nonstandard syntaxes, bouncing from one compiler to the next as we try to find the perfect build process. But what if there’s a better way? Learn how postprocessors and transpilers can revolutionize your code and workflow. If the idea of writing CSS4 and ES7 code today without compromising browser support sounds like crazy talk, you’re in for a wonderful surprise.'

Come join the discussion as we explore the docs and look at a few code samples to see what’s coming next.'
