  - title: 'Understanding Web Design'
    speaker:
      - name: Jeffrey Zeldman
        title: A List Apart, A Book Apart, An Event Apart
    description: 'When the institutions we have appointed to judge our best work do not understand the nature or value of that work, then our clients, bosses, and coworkers won’t understand it either. And their lack of understanding can put crippling limits on your professional happiness, your long-term career, and the success of your next project. It is hard enough to achieve good design when every stakeholder on your team understands it. But when half the people on your team, possibly including some key “creatives,” don’t know what you do or why you do it, it becomes impossible to deliver good design—design that delights, that achieves business goals and user goals, that creates communities, and that gives people capabilities they didn’t even know they wanted. Discover how to find the essence of our profession, and learn to become the ambassador for web design that our work and your career deserve.'
  - title: 'Designing Engagement'
    speaker:
      - name: Jaimee Newberry
        title:
    description: 'Engagement metrics aside, how are you engaging your users at an emotional level? How much thinking goes into the personality and tone of your product? What about writing the error messages, alerts, calls-to-action, descriptions, or release notes? Whether you have a playful concept, a big brand product yet to be built, or a product that's been out for a while, Jaimee wants to share some very important considerations in design thinking, on-boarding, and copywriting to help your products become more fun, delightful, and emotionally engaging experiences for your users.'
  - title: 'Designing Using Data'
    speaker:
      - name: Sarah Parmenter
        title: Founder, You Know Who
    description: 'Multi-platform design is hard. Decisions about content structure and hierarchy are often made hastily, with little foundation in reality. Instead of slavishly aping the latest UI trend, let’s design with data, producing designs and systems that yield predictable and desired results. Learn to design functional, beautiful interfaces with a solid backbone, supported by information-led processes tempered by your unique experience as a designer.'
  - title: 'Mobile First Responsive Web Design'
    speaker:
      - name: Jason Grigsby
        title: Co-Founder, Cloud Four
    description: 'Mobile first and responsive web design aren’t simply two great tastes that go great together—they represent far more than that. Mobile first responsive web design is the responsible way to build responsive design—the best way to create something that is both responsive from a layout and a performance perspective. But if mobile first is the right way to approach responsive design, then why are so few people doing it? Dig into why mobile first responsive design matters, and the techniques needed to make it work.'
  - title: 'Putting Your UI in Motion With CSS'
    speaker:
      - name: Val Head
        title: Design Advocate, Adobe
    description: 'CSS animations are a powerful option to add design details to your work. When used well, motion can improve interactions and bring delightful moments to the user experience. In this session, we’ll look at CSS in a whole new light—and use it, plus a little JavaScript, to craft interactions that bring our web-based work to life.'
  - title: 'The Map & The Territory'
    speaker:
      - name: Ethan Marcotte
        title: Author, Responsive Web Design
    description: 'When we create for the web, we participate in a kind of public art. We code, we design, we build for an audience, shaping digital experiences that provide a service, or that create joy, or that simply connect readers with words written half a world away. But in this session we’ll revisit what we’ve learned about responsive design, and ensure our content, not just our design, is readily accessible to them wherever and whenever they are. In doing so, we’ll look at some ways in which our audience reshapes the way we think about our medium, and see where they might be leading us—and the web—next.'
  - title: 'Enhance!'
    speaker:
      - name: Jeremy Keith
        title: Maker Of Websites
    description: 'We’re working on increasingly complex websites. There’s a temptation to match this growth with increasingly complex solutions. But there’s a real value in keeping things simple...or at least _starting_ things simple. If you can build a solid robust foundation, there’s a good chance that your work will be future-friendly. Prepare to have your brain subtly rewired as we look beneath the surface-level implementation details of the web to reveal the semantic structure below. Whether you’re publishing content or building the latest hot app, the principle of progressive enhancement will change the way you think about your work.'
  - title: 'The Developer’s Ampersandwich'
    speaker:
      - name: Jenn Lukas
        title: Freelance Developer
    description: 'Ever spent countless hours crafting a totally awesome type system for your beautiful design, only to have it lost in translation when it goes to development? Examine type and icon fonts through a developer lens, and learn how designers and front-end developers can work together to get everyone on the same (elegantly designed) page!'
  - title: 'Content in Context Is King'
    speaker:
      - name: Derek Featherstone
        title: Founder, Simply Accessible
    description: 'When most people think of Responsive Design, they think of fluid grids and adapting the layout of components in a site or application. But design goes far beyond layout. How far? We will start by combining content, context, and behavior in ways that let us create truly responsive sites—sites that meet the needs of the people using them, when they’re using them, and how they’re using them. Learn how to use clues like time, location, proximity, capabilities, and preferences to create better designs for users. After accounting for the device’s form factor, capabilities, and features, we’ll look at context of use, and the art of anticipation, delivering a more thoughtful, more useful user experience for everyone.'
  - title: 'Co-Design, Not Redesign'
    speaker:
      - name: Kevin M. Hoffman
        title: Founder, Seven Heads Design
    description: 'Organizations continue to pile features and fixes onto the redesign process. Companies that overlooked mobile are making big changes in a panic, while those with designs suitable for any device aren’t sure what to do next. One thing that won’t change is that people crave easier, faster, and more widespread access to their information and tools. Learn how service design thinking, lean approaches to user experience, and co-design processes offer an alternative to the money pit, and deliver experiences that delight your users.'
  - title: 'Touchy Subjects: Creating Content for Sensitive Situations'
    speaker:
      - name: Kate Kiefer Lee
        title: Writer & Editor, MailChimp
    description: 'Our readers and users are human. They have their own preferences, experiences, senses of humor, and perspectives—and they bring all of that to the table when they interact with our content. We can’t see our users, and we don’t know what’s going on in their lives, so we don’t always create experiences with their feelings in mind. Certain topics are likely to make them feel uncomfortable or frustrated. Sensitive content types many of us work on every day include error messages, alerts, legal content, financial information, and warnings. Learn how to address touchy subjects, anticipate the reader’s emotional state, and write from a place of empathy.'
  - title: 'Content in a Zombie Apocalypse'
    speaker:
      - name: Karen McGrane
        title: Author, Content Strategy for Mobile
    description: 'Friends, a zombie apocalypse is upon us: an onslaught of new mobile devices, platforms, and screen sizes, hordes of them descending every day. We’re outmatched. There aren’t enough designers and developers to battle every platform. There aren’t enough editors and writers to populate every screen size. Defeating the zombies will require flexibility and stamina—in our content. We’ll have to separate our content from its form, so it can adapt appropriately to different contexts and constraints. We’ll have to change our production workflow so we’re not just shoveling content from one output to another. And we’ll have to enhance our content management tools and interfaces so they’re ready for the future. Surviving the zombie apocalypse is possible, and Karen will explain how: by developing a content strategy that treats all our platforms as if they’re equally important.'
  - title: 'Screen Time'
    speaker:
      - name: Luke Wroblewski
        title: Product Director, Google
    description: 'When many of us were kids, screen time was how long we were allowed to sit in front of a TV. Screen time today is much more complex. People increasingly move between and simultaneously use screens of various sizes, proportions, and quality as they get online each day. From working around the differences in contrast between devices, to adjusting UI to compensate for different viewing differences; from RESS techniques to combine the best of server-side and responsive techniques, to the magic of vertical media queries and much more, you will gain a deeper understanding of screen time today, and explore new ways to design effective cross-screen experiences for tomorrow.'
  - title: 'Designing for Crisis'
    speaker:
      - name: Eric Meyer
        title: Author, CSS: The Definitive Guide
    description: 'It's easy to design for the idealized user, someone who's smart, calm, and informed. It's less easy, and thus more important, to design for a more realistic user: still smart, but harried and uncertain. The best designs handle both with care. But how many designs can help a user who is completely in the dark and barely capable of rational thought? In this talk, Eric will draw on his personal and professional experience to explore examples of crisis-mitigating design successes and failures. In the process, he'll illustrate ways that you can and should consider the needs of users teetering on the edge of panic. Helping them will make your designs more relevant and useful for all your users.'
  - title: 'The Elusive, Inclusive Web App'
    speaker:
      - name: Scott Jehl
        title: Author, Responsible Responsive Design
    description: 'You're excited about the ubiquity of the web. You want to build broadly accessible web experiences. But you don't want to compromise on delivering compelling, immersive experiences that feel at home in today's devices, even alongside native apps. Guess what: you don't need to compromise. Scott will discuss goals, patterns, and techniques for building client-side web applications today, and show you how “universal access,” “responsive design,” and “web app” can work together beautifully.'
  - title: 'How Designers Destroyed the World '
    speaker:
      - name: Mike Monteiro
        title: Design Director, Mule Design
    description: 'Designers have a responsibility, not only to themselves and to their clients, but also to the wider world. We are designers because we love to create, but creation without responsibility breeds destruction. Every day, designers all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them. This needs to change. In this bluntly honest talk, Mike will invite you to consider your responsibilities as a designer and embrace your role as gatekeeper. You’ll learn how to increase your influence and be moved to use your powers for good.'
  - title: 'Just Enough Research'
    speaker:
      - name: Erika Hall
        title: Co-founder, Mule Design Studio
    description: 'Every product, service, or interface we design in the safety and comfort of our workplaces has to survive and thrive in the real world. This means countless strangers will be using our creations in a chaotic environment over which we have no control. Research is the key to grounding ideas in reality and improving the odds of success, but research can be a very scary word. It may sound like money you don’t have, time you can’t spare, and expertise you have to seek. Fear no more. Learn practical, effective, efficient techniques that work within any design and development process to give you invaluable insight into your users and what they need and value. Not only will you reduce the risk of a wrong guess, you’ll also uncover new opportunities for innovation.'
  - title: 'How To Champion Ideas Back At Work'
    speaker:
      - name: Scott Berkun
        title: Author, The Year Without Pants
    description: 'An Event Apart, as the name says, is special indeed. But what happens when you leave? How will you act on what you’ve learned? This talk by master of design evangelism Berkun will show you how to bend the brains of your coworkers and clients to your will! You’ll get great advice on educating, inspiring and leading people who weren’t even at the show. Don’t miss this fun closing talk that will ensure you get as much value from your time after An Event Apart as you did during.'
