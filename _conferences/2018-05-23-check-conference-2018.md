  - title: 'Standardize De-Centralized Project Management'
    speaker:
      - name: Rebecca Grube
        title: University of Kansas Medical Center
    description: 'KUMCs PMO is comprised of a team of three, all of whom are new to the PMO in 2017, and who primarily manage projects closely associated with Information Technology. Being new with new staff, I created a new PMO intranet website to communicate and advertise project management and business analysis services, including considerations pertaining to new project requests, to a wider audience at KUMC. By building relationships and providing transparency into what the PMO does, we increased our project intake by 60% in just six months. We currently manage 51 active projects in various departments, including Compliance, Facilities, Public Safety, and Research and in coordination with the University of Kansas Health System, with an average of 2.5 new project requests each week. At this rate, it is estimated that we could have up to 92 active and new projects at this time next year. With no funds to increase my staff in the near future, it is important that I find alternative means to help others innovate independently of the PMO. KUMC employs approximately 120 employees who function as Project Managers, and as such, I have created a Project Management Academy to instill project management best practices, provide guidance, share knowledge, and identify challenges and areas of need. It’s also important to help them recognize when they can be successful without the PMO and provide insight into what the PMO can do to help and when it’s beneficial, or even required, to contact us for assistance. I really focused on what I wish someone would have shared with me when I first started as a PM. Our first session happened on January 24, 2018 with 55 participants and based on the feedback I received, I consider it a success. Our next one is scheduled in April 2018.'

  - title: 'Reducing Cybersecurity Risk with Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): Pilot Testing Duo at K-State'
    speaker:
      - name: Rob Caffey
        title: Kansas State University
      - name: Angela Chauncey
        title: Kansas State University
    description: 'Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a method of access control where an account holder must provide more than one piece of authentication  (e.g., withdrawing cash from an ATM requires an account card and a PIN). MFA increases security, reducing the ability of hackers and identity thieves to access data and computer systems. MFA also meets federal and state security requirements as well as operating standards for processes such as the Payment Card Industry(PCI). This presentation focuses on the approach and experiences for the expanded pilot of Duo, a multifactor authentication platform. Learn how we rolled out the solution over a period-of-time, measured progress and communicated with stakeholders. An overview of the project timeline and a look at successes and challenges will be shared.'

  - title: 'Managing Projects - Working with the Team to have a Successful Project'
    speaker:
      - name: Joyce Scheck
        title: Washburn University
    description: 'It’s difficult to define and structure a project. Have you been asked to manage a project and wonder how to get a team to function/work together to accomplish the end result? Come learn tips and tricks to manage projects. It’s not all about you and your process as a Project Manager. It is all about you working with the team to devise a structure that works for your team.  We will walk through a technical project like a Red hat 7 operating system upgrade and what was involved to define project scope, task assignments, when to pull in subject-matter experts, deadlines, resources, testing and plan for the production hardware cut-over.'
  - title: 'Cheap, Fast, and Good - Pick All Three for In-House Video Content'
    speaker:
      - name: Andrew Tash
        title: Hutchinson Community College
    description: 'In 2017, HutchCC Department 5 - Emergency Medical Services instructor Jon Friesen created and implemented Light Board technology for his Canvas courses. Springboarding from this initiative, ITS and Online Education started exploring Light Board creation for use with other departments. The Digital Media Team has worked on building a Light Board from scratch documenting concerns for budget limitations, appropriate building materials, production (pre-production-post), and developing workflow for turn-key use and distributing recorded lectures for online or hybrid delivery. Learn how the lessons Hutchinson Community College uncovered can assist you in creating your own Light Board technology.'
  - title: 'Fostering Innovation at Every Level'
    speaker:
      - name: Jeff Burns
        title: Pittsburg State University
      - name: Angela Neria
        title: Pittsburg State University
    description: 'IT departments in higher education are uniquely positioned to be leaders in innovation within the field of information technology. So why do so many university IT departments get stuck in the past? Learn how one university fosters an innovative culture at every level of the IT organization. Outside threats continue to impact higher education as we know it. There are daily news articles questioning the value of higher education, condemning collegial traditions, and more. Fiscal concerns at the state and federal levels have left higher education scrambling to support legacy systems as well as attract and retain experienced and motivated IT professionals. To stay relevant in the ever-changing world that we live in, higher education must innovate.  Where better for that innovation cycle to begin than in higher education IT departments? Learn how Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, KS made a simple choice to designate time and enthusiasm to the development of innovative ideas that support and extend the University’s mission to “provide transformational experiences for its students and community”. A simplistic design of a professional development program for the IT department’s Implementation and Development Team that included buy-in at every level, soon led to an "innovation shift" for the entire department broadening to other sectors of campus! Today, the University’s IT Strategic plan consists of a goal focused on innovation. These endeavors are measurable in many ways, but in others they are not. And its those immeasurable characteristics that may be the most rewarding: motivation, cultivation of ideas, learning from failure, attitude and outlook on our future, a shift in thinking and problem solving, and much more. Join us to learn how one simple idea, lots of enthusiasm, and patient guidance from leaders (both likely and unlikely) led our IT department to a culture of innovation!'
