Serving as a dashboard of various services for Kansas State University, K-State Connect was in need of a re-designed navigation system. The K-State <abbr title="Office of Mediated Education">OME</abbr> Web Team wanted to provide better access to the “widgets” within the Connect dashboard for both large and small screens.

For large screens, we decided on a dropdown list of each of the activated widgets.
